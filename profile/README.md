# Spoutcraft

Spoutcraft was a CraftBukkit plugin and modified client that allowed the plugin to give a mod like experience to the client without user instruction. Just simply join the server with the Spoutcraft client and the server does the rest. This early version of server-sided modding has now been modernized for modern machines.


# Projects
Respouted project is split between both preserving what was with our [Oldspout Launcher](https://github.com/ReSpouted/OldSpoutLauncher) and [Plugin](https://github.com/ReSpouted/ReSpouted-LegacyServer)

### Legacy

The original Spout project was for CraftBukkit 1.6. A lot of this original project has been lost to time and fails to run on modern computers.

The respouted project is designed to take the original project and gets it working on modern machines as well as trying to restore waht was lost as much as possible

### Modern

The idea of joining a server and all your mods automatically enabled without needing to download a modpack, handing conflicts, etc. 

The original Spoutcraft was a solution to this, that idea has stuck in the minds of many including us. 

So the Modern respouted project is a mod on the client and server that allows server mods to send extra abilities to the client including custom blocks, items and guis, giving mod like abilities without needing many mods on the client
