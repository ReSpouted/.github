# Spout

Spout was a CraftBukkit plugin and modified client that allows the plugin to give a mod like experience to the client without user instruction. Just simply join the server with the Spoutcraft client and the server does the rest.


# Projects
Respouted project comes in two flavours. 

## Legacy

The original Spout project was for CraftBukkit 1.6. A lot of this original project has been lost to time and fails to run on modern computers.

The respouted project is designed to take the original project and gets it working on modern computers as well as tries to restore as much as what was lost

## Modern

The idea of joining a server and all your mods automatically enabled without needing to download a modpack, handing conflicts, etc. 

The original Spout was a solution to this, that idea has stuck in the minds of many including us. 

So the Modern respouted project is a mod on the client and server that allows server mods to send extra abilities to the client including custom blocks, items and guis, giving mod like abilities without needing many mods on the client
